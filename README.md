# Health GLM (Epidemiological analysis from fine Particulate Matter (PM2.5))
##  Health data in the form of hospital admissions has been related to concentrations of PM2.5 using statistical models developed in R. This work has the purpose to estimate an indicative limit value for PM2.5 concentration. This value has been used to implement the PM2.5 standard. 
## An interesting and complete R script to process health data and PM2.5 air pollution data. The script processes health data using ICD-9 codes according so several criteria. The goal is to compute the Relative Risk curve (RR) and the relative risk coefficient per 10ug/m3 of exposed PM2.5. 
## Methodology for data exploration and statistical analysis is reported. Finally, a comprehensive Generalized Linear Model has been applied and customiszed to calculate the EXPOSURE curve for PM2.5. This is to measure the effect of PM2.5 on human health and to quantifiy its risk.
