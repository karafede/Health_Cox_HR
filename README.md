# Health GLM (Epidemiological analysis from fine Particulate Matter (PM2.5))
## An interesting and complete R script to process health data and PM2.5 air pollution data. The script processes health data using IC9 codes according so several criteria. The goal is to compute the Relative Risk curve (RR) and the relative risk coefficient per 10ug/m3 of exposed PM2.5. 
## Methodology for data exploration and statistical analysis is reported. Finally, a comprehensive Generalized Linear Model has been applied and customiszed to calculate the EXPOSURE curve for PM2.5. This is to measure the effect of PM2.5 on human health and to quantifiy its risk.
